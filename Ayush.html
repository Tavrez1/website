        <h1>The Definition of Cancer</h1>
        <p class="para">Cancer is a disease in which some of the body’s cells grow uncontrollably and
            spread to other parts of the body</p>
        <p class="para" id="para2">Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of
            trillions of cells. Normally, human cells grow and multiply (through a process
            called cell division) to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow old
            or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their place.</p>

        <h2>Types of Cancer</h2>
        <p>There are more than 100 types of cancer. Types of cancer are usually named for
            the organs or tissues where the cancers form. For example, lung cancer starts in
            the lung, and brain cancer starts in the brain. Cancers also may be described by
            the type of cell that formed them, such as an epithelial cell or a squamous cell. <br><br><br>
            Cancer is a genetic disease—that is, it is caused by changes to genes that control
            the way our cells function, especially how they grow and divide.</p>
